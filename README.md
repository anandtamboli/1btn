1btn (one button) uses the internet to complete a task with the simple, satisfying click of a single button. It connects to the internet over Wi-Fi to trigger whatever action you have assigned to it using a simple, online interface. One click, one task. It’s that simple.

Unlike many other “Internet of Things” devices, 1btn does not maintain a continuous connection to the internet. Instead, it sleeps until it is pressed, then it connects to the internet, performs the assigned task, tells you the outcome via its multi-colored LEDs, and then returns to rest.

As the Internet of Things has expanded, we’ve noticed an unfortunate trend: the increasing use of smartphones to control IoT applications. We don’t think a smartphone provides the best or simplest UI for this purpose. Think of all the steps you need to take to send a single instruction with a smartphone: find the phone, wake it up or power it up, enter your passcode, keep swiping until you find and start up your smart app, select the appropriate control, activate it, and then put the phone back to sleep.

We think there’s a better way, a tried-and-true, more intuitive way, to activate a single task or function, and that’s with a button. Why are buttons such a great idea? A button is the simplest user interface for a single-repetitive-programmable task. They are simple exactly because they are designed for a single-task. More importantly, buttons are easy-to-understand, they are familiar, intuitive, and provide immediate, satisfying physical feedback when pushed.
